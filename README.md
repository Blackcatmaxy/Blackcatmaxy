- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Bereza.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, Linux, and right to repair.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning repair, Rust, and F#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [BotCatMaxy](https://github.com/Blackcatmaxy/Botcatmaxy) which is a C# Discord Moderation bot.
- 📫 Find me on [Codeberg/Blackcatmaxy](https://codeberg.org/Blackcatmaxy) for my newer projects. Reach me on Discord via `blackcatmaxy` or [on my server](https://discord.blackcatmaxy.com). For quick direct communication, emails at blackcatmaxy@gmail.com will always work. Will eventually be active on [Matrix](https://matrix.org) too.

<!---
Blackcatmaxy/Blackcatmaxy is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
