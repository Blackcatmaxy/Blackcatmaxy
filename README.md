- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Bereza.
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, Linux, and right to repair.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning repair, Rust, and F#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [BotCatMaxy](https://github.com/Blackcatmaxy/Botcatmaxy) which is a C# Discord Moderation bot.
- 📫 Reach me on Discord via `Blackcatmaxy#4687` or [on my server](https://discord.blackcatmaxy.com). Will eventually be active on [Matrix](https://matrix.org) too.
